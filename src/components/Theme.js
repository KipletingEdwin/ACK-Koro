        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>We are a congregation of the Church of the Anglican Church of Kenya in the Diocese of Eldoret</p>

                <p>The A.C.K is a member of the worldwide Anglican Communion. St. Mark’s is a parish 
                    church and its congregation comes from all over Nairobi and beyond. The St. Mark’s 
                    Church was built in 1907 on a site near Parklands. During the 1950s the present
                     larger building in Westlands was planned and opened in 1958. The site of the old
                      church was dismantled in 1970. Some of the pews and stained glass windows were 
                      however transferred to the new church.</p>

            <div className='para2'>
                <p>After the church came to the present site a church hall was built. The hall was in 
                    need of expansion to cater for the growth of the church. St. Mark’s has also helped
                     in the establishment of the NYARI PARISH as well as the Nursery School. About twelve
                      years ago St. Mary’s Church Kabete and St. Joseph’s Church Kabete were made a 
                      separate parish which has continued to grow in strength.</p>
